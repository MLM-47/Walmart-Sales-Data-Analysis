# Approach Used
## 1. Feature engineering: This will enable us to create new columns out of preexisting ones.
1.To provide insight into sales in the morning, afternoon, and evening, add a new column called time_of_day. This will assist in providing an answer to the query of what time of day most sales occur.
2.Create a new column called day_name and fill it with the extracted weekdays (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri) that the specified transaction occurred on. This will assist in providing an answer to the query of which day of the week each branch is busiest.
3.Create a new column called month_name and enter the extracted months (Jan, Feb, Mar) of the year that the given transaction occurred in. Assist in identifying the month with the highest profit and sales for the year.
